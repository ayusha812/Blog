        In a fixed mindset, people believe their basic qualities, like their
        intelligence or talent, are simply fixed traits. In a growth mindset,
        people believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through
        dedication and hard work—brains and talent are just the starting point.
      </p>

      <p>
        With fixed mindsets, we don’t let ourselves explore the possibility of
        getting better at something – we feel ok in our comfort zones and we
        don’t want to put in any effort towards learning and growing. However,
        with growth mindsets, we understand that in order to be successful, we
        need to learn in order to grow and improve our abilities. A simple way
        to figure out whether you have a fixed or growth mindset is by listening
        to what you tell yourself, especially in the face of challenge. Let’s
        say you worked on a business idea/plan for a year and it wasn’t
        successful. Are you more likely to give up totally because “I am just
        not a business person”? Or would you take it as a learning experience,
        set new goals, find new pathways, see what has worked for other people,
        etc? Those with fixed mindsets usually limit themselves.
      </p>

      <p>
        Unlike the growth mindset crew, they usually do not jump at
        opportunities for learning and growing.Fixed mindset crews’
        conversations include things like “I’m not good enough’, “It’s too
        hard”, “I can never swim”, “I’m so lazy and lack discipline”.

        Growth mindset’ is not always inborn, neither is the ‘fixed mindset’.
        Sometimes, the way we are praised can show up in our lives as either
        fixed or growth mindsets. Think about a child who was told “you are very
        smart”, versus the one who was told “you are very disciplined with your
        studies”
      </p>

      <p>
        Who do you think would fall under the growth mindset category? The one
        who was praised for his smartness is more likely to grow up having a
        fixed mindset. “I’m smart, I don’t have to learn new things. I’m smart,
        whatever I do is okay. I’m smart, failure isn’t for me”. The one who was
        praised for his discipline will be willing to put some more discipline
        into so many other areas of life, and he will be willing to try a little
        harder when something gets challenging.
      </p>

        Yes, praise is good, but it can sometimes be not-so-good. Praising the
        process is better than praising the person. The same applies to younger
        kids. When my two year old Haneef shares his toys with friends, the
        fixed-mindset-me would say “wow Haneef, you’re the best”
